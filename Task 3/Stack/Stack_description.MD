A stack is an abstract data type( an abstract data type means a conceptual or mathematical 
model which specifies different types of operations on that data type, but does not specify
how these operations will be implemented.Ex-stack,queue.list).

In a stack we can perform the following operations :

1. Push: to add an element at top of the stack.
2. Pop: to remove an element from the top of stack.
3. Display: to print the stack content from top to bottom.
4. Peek: to print the topmost element.

A stack works on LIFO (Last In First Out) basis.It means the element which is pushed at the
last will be popped first out of the stack and the element which is pushed first will be 
popped at the last.

Applications:

1. To reverse a string
2. Backtracking
3. Converting infix to postfix expressions., etc.
